# PyTorch fpsample

PyTorch efficient farthest point sampling (FPS) implementation, adopted from [fpsample](https://github.com/leonardodalinky/fpsample).

**Currently, this project is under heavy development and not ready for production use. If you want to make a contribution on implementing the GPU version, please feel free to contact me and make PRs.**

> [!NOTE]
> Since the PyTorch capsules the native multithread implementation, this project is expected to have a much better performance than the *fpsample* implementation.

## Installation

```bash
# Install from github
pip install git+https://github.com/leonardodalinky/pytorch_fpsample

# Build locally
pip install .
```

## Usage

```python
import torch_fpsample

x = torch.rand(64, 2048, 3)
# random sample
sampled_points, indices = torch_fpsample.sample(x, 1024)
# random sample with specific tree height
sampled_points, indices = torch_fpsample.sample(x, 1024, h=5)
# random sample with start point index (int)
sampled_points, indices = torch_fpsample.sample(x, 1024, start_idx=0)

> sampled_points.size(), indices.size()
Size([64, 1024, 3]), Size([64, 1024])
```

> [!WARNING]
> Note: The GPU version is not implemented yet. Only CPU mode is available.

## Reference
Bucket-based farthest point sampling (QuickFPS) is proposed in the following paper. The implementation is based on the author's Repo ([CPU](https://github.com/hanm2019/bucket-based_farthest-point-sampling_CPU) & [GPU](https://github.com/hanm2019/bucket-based_farthest-point-sampling_GPU)).
